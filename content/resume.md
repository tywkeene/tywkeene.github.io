### Contrast Security - *Software Engineer II*
##### *(Dec. 2019 - April 2024)*
When I joined Contrast Security, I started in the contrast-service team. The
contrast service acted as an intermediary between the dynamic language agents
(DAST) and the Contrast frontend internally called Teamserver. The service
handled http requests to scan for OWASP and other vulnerabilities for the Go,
Node, Python and Ruby agents.

After a few years, I moved to the team that develops the Go Language Agent,
developing support for both the Assess and Protect products, as well as
providing support and assistance to Support Engineers dealing with customer
issues while also maintaining legacy support for the Contrast Service.

### Ardan Labs - *Software Engineer*
##### *(Jun. - Aug. 2019)*
At Ardan Labs I worked on a team that developed backend Golang services for a
client in the financial technology sector using other technologies such as
MongoDB, Docker, Swagger Documentation and Ruby on Rails with CI through
Jenkins.

### Moasis - *Software Engineer*
##### *(Jun. 2017 - Feb. 2019)*
At Moasis I had a large role in the design and development of a location based
mobile advertising product, with over 150k requests/second throughput
system-wide consisting of five microservice codebases using Golang,
gRPC/Protobuf for distributed messaging and a Postgres backend deployed to
Google Cloud hosted Kubernetes.

### Influx Data - *Contract Technical Consultant*
##### *(Jan. - Mar. 2016)*
At InfluxData I utilized Docker, Ruby, and Bash scripts to provide a
containerized testbed environment, and assisted the main development team in
writing scripts, plugins and the documentation of the InfluxDB time series
database.
